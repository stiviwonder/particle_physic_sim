# PARTICLE PHYSIC SIMULATOR
***

This is a particle based fluid simulator. (WIP)
This version is implemented using the most naive method with O(n^2) complexity.
you can adjust de attraction and repulsion radius/force to get different behaivours.
the location of those constants is in ``` /particle/mod.rs```
